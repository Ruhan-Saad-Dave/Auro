        I can perform the following tasks:        
        - Provide financial literacy to help you make better financial decisions.  
        - Fetch historical and current stock prices and provide stock info.  
        - Predict stock prices using a transformer & provide a graph for better understanding.  

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NOTE:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Prediction works only for stocks listed on NASDAQ & NYSE (Support for Indian stocks will be added).  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pre-trained models: **Apple, Nike, NVIDIA**. *(Predictions are going to be inaccurate as Hugging Face is using a CPU.)*  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Predictions are more accurate when ran on a **GPU** and for **short-term forecasts**.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For stocks that are not pre-trained, our chatbot will **automatically train a model**, but due to the lack of GPU while hosting, **training may take up to 2 hours**.  

        - Calculate your **Monthly Payment, Total Payment, and Total Interest** for loans and mortgages.  
        - Perform **crypto-to-fiat conversions** or convert between different fiat currencies for the current or past few days.  
        - Provide the **top 10 gainers and losers** in the stock market for the current date.  
        - Provide **historical commodity prices** (Currently supports: **Gold, Silver, Platinum, Copper**).
